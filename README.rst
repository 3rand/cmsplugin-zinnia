Cmsplugin-zinnia is a bridge between django-blog-zinnia and django-cms.

This package provides plugins, menus and apphook to integrate your Zinnia
powered Weblog into your django-cms Web site.

The code bundled in this application is a copy of the original
`zinnia.plugins` module made for forward compatibility with Zinnia v0.11.
